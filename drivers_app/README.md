<h1>MyRide Driver App</h1>
This is the Driver App for the MyRide mobile application developed using Flutter. It is designed specifically for drivers who are part of the MyRide transportation network. The app provides a user-friendly interface and features that help drivers manage their rides and provide efficient transportation services to passengers.<br/><br/>

Here are some key features of the MyRide Driver App:<br/>
1. Registration and Profile Management: Drivers can create an account and complete their profile.<br/>

2. Ride Requests: The app allows drivers to receive ride requests from passengers who are using the MyRide user app. Drivers can accept or decline requests based on their availability and location.<br/>

3. Navigation and Directions: Once a ride request is accepted, the app provides built-in navigation and turn-by-turn directions to help drivers reach the pick-up location and the destination efficiently.<br/>

4. Real-Time Tracking: The app enables real-time tracking of the driver's location, which is shared with the passenger. This feature helps passengers stay informed about the driver's arrival time and track the progress of their journey.<br/>
